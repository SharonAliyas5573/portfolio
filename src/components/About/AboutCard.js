            Hi Everyone, I am <span className="purple">Sharon Aliyas Johnson </span>
            from <span className="purple"> Kerala, India.</span>
            <br /> I am pursuing B-Tech 
            in <span className="purple">Computer Science (Cyber Security)</span>
            <br />
            <br/>
            I'm passionate about the art of programming and have been on an exciting journey of learning and discovery. With a mix of dedication and curiosity, I've ventured into the world of coding and picked up a few tricks along the way. ðŸš€
            <br />
            <br/>
            Feel free to reach out for collaboration, projects, or simply to geek out over all things tech!
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
